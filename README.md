The Smart Bulb is a versatile and exciting project that combines the power of the ESP8266
microcontroller with the vibrant world of RGB LEDs. This project allows you to create a webbased interface to control RGB LED LIGHT, making it an ideal choice for lighting enthusiasts,
DIY hobbyists, and home automation enthusiasts. We are sending a “GET” request from our
custom webpage that will have a color picker to send red, green, and blue values. The ESP8266
NodeMCU ESP-12E receives data and sets the color of the RGB LED based on the color
picker values.
